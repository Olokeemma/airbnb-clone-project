### 💡 Importance of a User-Friendly Design

A user-friendly design is essential in a booking platform because it directly affects user experience and conversion rates. The easier it is to navigate, search, and book, the more likely users will complete transactions. Key elements like clear call-to-action buttons, logical layout, and responsive feedback make the interface smooth and reliable.

A strong UX design helps:
- Reduce bounce rate
- Improve trust and satisfaction
- Increase completed bookings
- Enhance accessibility for all users
